# Next Banking

A MVP for a banking application built with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**.

> **Important**: For the purposes of this assessment, no real SQL database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.) has been integrated.
> Instead, all data is stored in memory. This approach allows you to run and test the application quickly in a local environment without additional setup. However, data will be lost when the server restarts.
